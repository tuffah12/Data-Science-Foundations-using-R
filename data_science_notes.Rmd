2. [Bioconductor repository](https://rdocumentation.org/)
3. [GitHub](https://github.com)

  * `remove.packages("ggplot2")` removes it again
* `library(ggplot2)`: opens and initialised ggplot2 for use
  * `detach("package:ggplot2", unload=TRUE)` unloads it again
* `update.packages()`: update all packages

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
